GIT Workflow
=============

1. Open up this page. (Man you're good at this!)
2. Open a git shell and change to top /justinthyme
3. run `git pull` to get any new changes.
4. Do some work. Do a lot actually.
5. It's been a while since step 4, run `git status` and look at all the stuff you've changed!
6. Make sure all of the file you have changed are under **staged for commit** and not **untracked**. For any files under **untracked**, run `git add filename` to add those new files.
7. Now you're ready to commit. Run `git commit -m "talk about what changes you did here"`
8. Last but not least, run `git push` to push your changes to the remote repository.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to push your work after you're done or else you will have to de merges (ewww).
